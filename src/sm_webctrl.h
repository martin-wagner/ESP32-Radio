 *
 * This state machine monitors digital inputs from rocker switch and uses them to control
 * the web radio.
 * We have three digital inputs for the switch
 * - direction
 * - (slow) movement
 * - fast movement.
 * By mechanics, "movement" is active as soon as the rocker switch is moved in any direction.
 * "fast movement" can be activated in addition to "movement" by pushing the switch beyond the
 * indentation. Circuit design makes direction input default "right". Any event on this input
 * means switch has been pushed to the left.
 * We also use the dial movement control state machine as input. This is required because
 * the control feeds back to the inputs inside hardware.
 *
 * From those inputs we have to detect the following information
 * - is the switch in idle position?
 * - is the switch pushed to the left/right first indentation?
 *  -> event left / right
 * - is the switch pushed to the left/right limit?
 *  -> event far left / right
 * - is pick-up input enabled?
 *  -> event radio / pick-up active
 * - is the movement control state machine non-idle?
 *  -> suppress any event /todo assume radio and generate event radio active?
 *
 * Knowing pick-up mode is somewhat essential for proper funcion
 * - wireless communication leads to distortion in fm reception
 *  -> disable web radio when pick-up is not enabled, nobody is listening anyway...
 * - when no switch is active and radio is active, part of the audio signal is coupled
 *   on top of the high-Z search dc signal, leading to erroneous detection of input changes
 *  -> disable event generation when pick-up is not enabled
 * However we might not have a digital input for that, so some guesswork is implemented in
 * software.
 * todo finish detection, currently requires pick-up active input signal
